# medusa-plugin-feeds

This is a plugin for MedusaJS designed to create basic Shopping feeds for Google and Facebook. The project is just getting started and there's still lots of work to be done.

## Features

- Exposes custom endpoints to fetch feeds in XML or JSON format:
    - `/feed/xml`
    - `/feed/json`
    - `/admin/feed/xml`
    - `/admin/feed/json`

The last two endpoints are used internally by the admin panel to fetch the feeds.

## Usage


### Plugin Options

To enable Admin UI extensions, set the `enableUI` option to `true` in the plugin options.

## Contributing

The project is in its early stages. Contributions are welcome 💚🙏.
